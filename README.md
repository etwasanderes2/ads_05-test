# ads_05-test

If my algorithm works these should work as well.

test files:
The n-th line contains ", " (comma space) seperated values, where the i-th value is the distance from Airport n to Airport i or -1 if no connection exists. (Exactly like the input array.)

solution files:
The n-th line contains the minimal distance from Airport 0 to Airport n.

(all indices start at 0)

Feel free to add more tests if you are reasonably sure that they'll work.
If the solution files are incorrect, please tell me / fix them yourself.

I stole some code from the last test
